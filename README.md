# Good Time

Come and have a good time with your friends !

The website is directly addressed to bar owners for them to log their establishment in, their menu, their drinks, and get people to find them easily.

## How to launch

You'll need Symfony, composer & co.

Run `bin/console server:run` in the project's directory.

In dev mode, also launch Wamp/Lamp to have a local database. A creation file and a dump are located in `src/Migrations/`. User password is always `123456`.

Don't forget ton run `composer install` in the project's root folder.
